# A sentiment analysis study
I used 4 different Twitter account datasets.
The main task was to develop a sentiment analysis pipeline
that would take in a dataset composed of tweets and return sentiment scores.

The second task was to analyze the sentiment scores of the tweets,
and make good use of results through a filter.
